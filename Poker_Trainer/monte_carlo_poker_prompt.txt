# Monte Carlo Poker Hand Analysis Prompt

## OBJECTIVE
Generate comprehensive poker hand analysis data using Monte Carlo simulation for a poker training application. Calculate exact probabilities, hand strengths, and optimal strategies for all possible scenarios.

## REQUIREMENTS

### 1. HAND ENUMERATION
- Generate all 169 unique preflop starting hands (13 pairs + 78 suited + 78 offsuit)
- Calculate exact combinations for each hand (e.g., AA has 6 combinations, AKs has 4 combinations)
- Create hand rankings from strongest to weakest based on preflop equity

### 2. MONTE CARLO SIMULATION PARAMETERS
- Run minimum 100,000 simulations per hand analysis
- Test against 1-9 opponents for each scenario
- Calculate win rate, tie rate, and loss rate for each hand
- Provide confidence intervals (95% confidence level)

### 3. POSITION-BASED ANALYSIS
Calculate optimal ranges for each position:
- UTG (Under the Gun): Tight range, ~12-15% of hands
- MP (Middle Position): Medium range, ~18-22% of hands  
- CO (Cut-Off): Wider range, ~25-30% of hands
- BTN (Button): Widest range, ~45-55% of hands
- SB (Small Blind): Steal range, ~35-45% of hands
- BB (Big Blind): Defend range, ~25-35% vs BTN

### 4. SCENARIO-SPECIFIC CALCULATIONS

#### A. PREFLOP SCENARIOS
- Opening ranges by position
- 3-betting ranges vs different position opens
- 4-betting ranges vs 3-bets
- Calling ranges vs raises
- Squeeze play ranges (3-betting vs opener + caller)

#### B. STACK DEPTH CONSIDERATIONS
- Short stack (20-40bb): Push/fold calculations
- Medium stack (40-100bb): Standard play
- Deep stack (100bb+): Implied odds adjustments

#### C. OPPONENT COUNT ADJUSTMENTS
- Heads-up equity vs 1 opponent
- Multi-way pot equity vs 2-8 opponents
- Adjust ranges based on number of players

### 5. HAND STRENGTH CALCULATIONS
For each hand, calculate:
- Raw equity percentage vs random hands
- Equity vs tight range (top 15% of hands)
- Equity vs loose range (top 40% of hands)
- Equity vs calling range
- Equity vs 3-betting range

### 6. ADVANCED METRICS
- Fold equity requirements for profitable bluffs
- Pot odds requirements for calls
- Implied odds calculations for speculative hands
- Reverse implied odds for dominated hands

### 7. GTO (Game Theory Optimal) ANALYSIS
- Mixed strategy frequencies for marginal hands
- Indifference points for calling vs folding
- Optimal bet sizing based on hand strength
- Balanced ranges to prevent exploitation

### 8. OUTPUT FORMAT

  }
}
```

### 9. SPECIFIC CALCULATIONS NEEDED

#### A. PREMIUM HANDS (AA, KK, QQ, JJ, AKs, AKo)
- 4-betting ranges vs 3-bets
- Slow-play frequencies
- Stack-off thresholds

#### B. MARGINAL HANDS (22-99, Suited connectors, Ax suited)
- Calling ranges vs raises
- Set mining profitability
- Fold equity requirements

#### C. SPECULATIVE HANDS (Small suited connectors, suited gappers)
- Implied odds calculations
- Multi-way pot profitability
- Position requirements

### 10. VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS
- Compare results against known GTO solvers (PioSolver, GTO+)
- Validate against published poker literature
- Cross-reference with professional player ranges
- Ensure mathematical consistency across all scenarios

### 11. ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS
- Account for rake in cash games
- Tournament ICM considerations
- Bubble factor adjustments
- Short-handed vs full-ring adjustments

### 12. IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
- Use proper random number generation
- Implement efficient hand evaluation algorithms
- Cache results for identical scenarios
- Provide progress indicators for long calculations
- Include statistical significance testing

## EXPECTED OUTPUT
A comprehensive database containing:
- 169 starting hands with complete analysis
- Position-specific recommendations
- Scenario-based action frequencies
- Equity calculations with confidence intervals
- GTO-based mixed strategies
- Exploitative adjustments for different opponent types

This data will power a poker training application that teaches optimal preflop play through interactive scenarios and immediate feedback on decision quality.
